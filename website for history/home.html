    <p>The Railways: In India the railways were not built to have any development on the economical side and were actually built to carry cotton since cotton on dirt makes it dirty to use.The first railway in India was 21 miles long from Bombay(Mumbai) to Thane(Maharashtra). The idea of connecting a railway from Bombay to Thane first occurred to George Clark, The Chief Engineer of the Bombay Government. This thought occurred to him in 1843. Railroads were also used to trade quicker and more efficiently. But doing so resulted in economic conditions and pollution in the country. A person named Lord Dalhousie was the one who came to India to serve as the Governor General of the country and was also the one who convinced the government to build railways in 1848. After 5 years, The first railroad was introduced</p>
    <h1>Transport System # 2. Road Transport:</h1>
    <p>When the British came to India they introduced steamships in order to improve the roads. Work on the Grand Trunk Road in Kolkata to Delhi in 1839 and was completed in the 1850â€™s. They also tried to make roads in the cities and the market of the country. After a bit, roads were constructed as of 4 categories which were national highways,state highways,major district roads and village roads. Since the government was in short supply for the road construction, it had been delayed. Road transport was mostly also used for trading, people used to get on Horses and wagons. But the horses could not lift enough weight to carry so they made multiple trips in order to do a trade. After some time, the roads had spread all over the country and were very much useful for people that walked long distances.</p>

    <h1>Transport System # 3:River Transport</h1>
    <p>Before the 1800s, river transportation was amazing. For long travel to take items from one state to another would make it so the river and the boats would last long enough for people to travel long distances. Later the Indian shipping industry would have decreased and the British had gone higher than the Indian companies. The Main rivers that were used to transport were called the Brahmaputra river and the Barak-Sulma rivers. Later, the tea industry had gone up and people needed to use the rivers more often to trade. The main place for trading in water used to be northeast India and the port of Calcutta(Kolkata,Bengal).</p>
